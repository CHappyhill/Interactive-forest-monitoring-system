After data collection, users transfered the collected data to the database server\r\n1) ODK Form used for forest disturbance monitoring in Ethiopia is stored in CBM/Form \r\n2) Sample data collected through ODK form is stored in Data/sampleODKdata \r\n3) Subset of 300 Community-based observation data are stored in Data/Community-based observation.csv \r\n\r\nFull community-based observation data can be downlaoded from www.cbm.wur.nl  \r\n\r\n\r\n# Landsat image time-series analysis\r\n\r\nFollowing process chain was developed to download, store and process Landsat image time-series. \r\n\r\n1) Download the data: All the historic as well as continuously acquired Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI surface reflectance images with WRS-2 coordinates path 170 and row 55 at processing level LT1 were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center Science Processing Architecture (ESPA, http://espa.cr.usgs.gov).\r\nScene ID of all data used is stored in Data/Landsat time-series.csv. \r\n\r\n2) Pre-processing : After downloading the Landsat data, multiple pre-processing steps were applied: application of the FMASK algorithm for cloud masking, computation of NDVI and application of a forest mask. \r\n\r\n3) Change detection : We used the BFAST Monitor method for breakpoint detection in Landsat NDVI time-series images for NRT forest change detection. \r\n\r\ncode for this analysis is stored in Code/Landsat time-series analysis/BFAST_forestchangedetection.R   \r\n\r\n\r\n# Spatial database structure\r\nPostGre SQL database was used to store community-based monitoring and satellite based forest change alert data data. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Web mapping \r\n\r\nApache, GeoServer, OpenLayers, jQuery, PhP and HTML was used for web-mapping. \r\nAll relevant codes used for web mapping are stored in Webgis folder Code/Webgis. \r\n\r\nPhP files allow  dynamic spatiotemporal query and allow users to generate forest change locations on-demand, to download forest change locations in usable GPS exchange format (GPX) format. \r\n\r\n#References\r\n\r\nPratihast AK, DeVries B, Avitabile V, de Bruin S, Herold M, Bergsma A (2016) Design and Implementation of an Interactive Web-Based Near Real-Time Forest Monitoring System.
